\description{
The MSEP is made up of HUC4s 0317 (Pearl River watershed) and 0318 (Pascagoula River watershed). This is the outline of their union, clipped to the state of Mississippi's cartographic boundaries (i.e. following the contours of land and islands). The watershed extends into both Louisiana and Alabama, but this boundary is clipped to the state of Mississippi only (as MSEP's current funding only allows work within the state).

\details{
The raw data were subsetted to the geopackage file \code{msep_hucs.gpkg} using the script \code{subset_NHD.R}. The subset was further processed into this final form, using the \code{tigris} package for state and cartographic boundary delineations, in \code{make_boundaries.R}.
Both scripts and the subsetted geopackage file are available in the \code{data-raw} directory of the package repository at:
