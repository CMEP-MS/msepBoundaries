\details{
The raw data were subsetted to the geopackage file \code{msep_hucs.gpkg} using the script \code{subset_NHD.R}. The subset was further processed into this final form, using the \code{tigris} package for state and cartographic boundary delineations, in \code{make_boundaries.R}.
Both scripts and the subsetted geopackage file are available in the \code{data-raw} directory of the package repository at:
\url{https://github.com/CMEP-MS/msepBoundaries}.
